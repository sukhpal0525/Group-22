## Installation

A few components on your computer must be installed before you can use our PC Lab website. The hosting and operation of our website locally require these elements:

- Installing XAMPP, a free and open-source software bundle that consists of the Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP programming language, will enable you to run our website locally. The official Apache Friends website offers XAMPP for download, which is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

- The Apache and MySQL services must be started from the XAMPP Control Panel after you have downloaded and installed XAMPP. You will then be able to access our website through your web browser and host it locally on your computer.

- In addition to XAMPP, you will need to install Tomcat, a web server that supports Java Server Pages (JSP) and Java Servlets. On the Apache Tomcat website, Tomcat is also available for free download.

- After setting up Tomcat, you can deploy our website on it by copying its files to the proper directory. Tomcat might need to be set up to use the MySQL database for data storing and retrieval.

- You can host and operate our PC Lab website locally on your computer and access it via a web browser by installing these components. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with our customer service team for help if you have any inquiries or run into any problems.
