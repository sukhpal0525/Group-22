## PC Lab

Welcome to the PC parts store! An online store for the people who are looking forward to Upgrade their PC's using different GPUs, Processor, Motherboard, Memory, and Storage for a better user experience. Here is everything you need to know to get started:



## Prerequisites

To run this project, the following prerequisites are required:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): This Spring boot Java application requires installation of Java 8 or later version. It is better to use the latest version.
- Maven or Gradle: You can use either Maven or Gradle build tools.
- IDE: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans. Use either of them based on your preferences.
- Database: The database for the project needs to be installed and configured on your system so that this application could interact with the database.
- Web browser: You will need a web browser to test your web application if you are developing one.
- Operating system: You can use different Operating systems including Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Installation

A few components on your computer must be installed before you can use our PC Lab website. The hosting and operation of our website locally require these elements:

- Install MySQL, an open source relational database management system. MySQL can be downloaded for free from the official MySQL website. 

- After installing MySQL, we recommend that you also install MySQL Workbench, a visual tool for managing MySQL databases. MySQL Workbench can also be downloaded for free from the official MySQL website. 

- Installing Apache Tomcat, a web server that supports JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlets, is also required in addition to MySQL. Tomcat can be downloaded from the Apache Tomcat website.

- After setting up Tomcat, you can deploy our website on it by copying its files to the proper directory. Tomcat may need to be set up to use the MySQL database for data storing and retrieval.

- You can host and run our PC Labs website locally on your computer and access it through your web browser by installing these components, using MySQL Workbench to manage the MySQL database, and configuring your computer. Contacting our customer service team for help is always welcome if you have any questions or run into any problems.
